============

Game Accessibility for Unity3D projects.

This project aims at providing solutions to common accessibility problems which are
not possible to do without programming. The project uses the guidelines at 
gameaccessibilityguidelines.com as a roadmap. Unity was chosen as the starting point,
but this project may include other game engines later.
